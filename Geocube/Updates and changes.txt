  Features:
  - Waypoint filters can filter on account.
  - Add support for locationless caches: You can see them and
    tag them for planning.
  - Logs with coordinates can now be mapped. This is most likely
    only for moveables and locationless caches.
  - GCA: Logs now can contain coordinates.
  - When downloading configuration only the changed parts are
    downloaded instead of everything.
  - Auto-populate locaties (suburb, town, city) based on Geodata
    of the OpenCage Data project.
  - Add Gadget cache type.
  - At startup after an upgrade, you will get a headsup that the
    configuration needs to be reloaded.
  - At startup it will check for updates in the configuration.
  - Localization to the Dutch language.
  - Automatic creation of backups of the database.
  - Be able to strip the HTML code from the description.
  - Add beeper to be able to find out where the phone was left.
  - Be able to extra EXIF GNSS data from images into a waypoint.

  Fixes:
  - Made the UI for a waypoint more sane with regards to "what is
    disabled and what is not".
  - Checkers for input of coordinates don't complain about trailing
    's anymore.
  - Fix waypoint info vertical position after having submitted the
    logs of a waypoint.
  - Not all logtypes were recognized on GCA.
  - Removed some duplicate/obsolete fields from the database tables.
  - GPS -> GNNS.
  - Fixed the sometimes disappearance of the Local Menu button.
  - Refresh of trackables won't show doubles anymore.
  - Moved several developer tabs to the Developer menu.
  - Refresh waypoints on the map will not hang forever anymore if
    there are more than 1 records to be returned via the LiveAPI.
  - When the interface was landscape before the map was loaded, the
    waypoint infoviewer wouldn't resize properly when the interface
    was set back to portrait. That is now fixed.
  - When opening a non-downloaded image, download it.
  - Waypoints added as the first sub waypoint of a waypoint would
    not be in an usergroup and removed at the next cleanup. Fixed
    now.

Version 1.3(26)

  Features:
  - Geocaching.com website account type. While it doesn't support
    the LiveAPI or the "Reload Waypoints" feature on the map, you
    can download Pocket Queries, "Refresh Waypoint", Trackables.
  - In the Tools -> GPS section, be able to create a waypoint on
    the average coordinates.
  - Added log templates and log macros.
  - The logs can be prepopulated with templates.
  - Saved logs can be seen in the Saved Logs overview under Notes.
  - Groundspeak geocaching.com: Corrected Coordinates are now imported
    properly.

  Fixes:
  - iPad: The query table cells are now properly resized.
  - iPad: The picker dialog box are now working properly.
  - "Waypoint disabled" log image is now 30x30.
  - Queries: A better way to display that there is nothing.
  - Improved fonts, indents on views on the iPad.
  - Made Geocaching Australia authentication more obvious.
  - Statistics screen is now a proper table.
  - Waypoint Info view under the map for the iPad now looks better.
  - When downloading a lot the InfoViewer at the bottom now should
    show up properly even if there is a lot of delay.
  - When a GPX import fails, be noisy about it instead of going
    from "yeah all is fine".
  - During the very first run, the Application Support directory
    doesn't exist on the sandbox on a hardware device, despite it
    being a system directory. This would cause the initial
    download of the configuration to fail as there was no database
    yet. During a second run it did exist because of a file cache
    was created in the Application Support directory.
  - File Browser now works with the Application Support Directory.

    of screen.
