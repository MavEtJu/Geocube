Interesting additions and changes to Geocube

Version 1.3(xx)

  Features:
  - Geocaching.com website account type. While it doesn't support
    the LiveAPI or the "Reload Waypoints" feature on the map, you
    can download Pocket Queries, "Refresh Waypoint", Trackables.
  - In the Tools -> GPS section, be able to create a waypoint on
    the average coordinates.
  - Added log templates and log macros.
  - The logs can be prepopulated with templates.
  - Saved logs can be seen in the Saved Logs overview under Notes.
  - Groundspeak geocaching.com: Corrected Coordinates are now imported
    properly.

  Fixed:
  - iPad: The query table cells are now properly resized.
  - iPad: The picker dialog box are now working properly.
  - "Waypoint disabled" log image is now 30x30.
  - Queries: A better way to display that there is nothing.
  - Improved fonts, indents on views on the iPad.
  - Made Geocaching Australia authentication more obvious.
  - Statistics screen is now a proper table.
  - Waypoint Info view under the map for the iPad now looks better.
  - When downloading a lot the InfoViewer at the bottom now should
    show up properly even if there is a lot of delay.
  - When a GPX import fails, be noisy about it instead of going
    from "yeah all is fine".
  - During the very first run, the Application Support directory
    doesn't exist on the sandbox on a hardware device, despite it
    being a system directory. This would cause the initial
    download of the configuration to fail as there was no database
    yet. During a second run it did exist because of a file cache
    was created in the Application Support directory.
  - File Browser now works with the Application Support Directory.
